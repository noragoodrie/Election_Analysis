# Election_Analysis

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This week the purpose of our challenge was to make a python script to be able to deliever the following information once the script runs.
1.	Total number of votes cast
2.	A complete list of candidates who received votes
3.	Total number of votes each candidate received
4.	Percentage of votes each candidate won
5.	The winner of the election based on popular vote

This week the software we used to run this challenge was Visual Studio Code as well as, terminal which was made the ability to link to VSC for an easier transition of data. This challenge we needed to break down and read CSV files, and be able to save our script into a txt file to visualize the end data much easier!

**RESULTS**

-	In this congressional election there were a total of 379,111 votes.

- There were 3 candidates who were running in this election.
  1.	Charles Casper Stockham
  2.	Diana DeGette
  3.	Raymon Anythony Doane
 
- Charles C. Stockham had a vote count of 85,213 which brings him to a 23% turnout of the total votes.
- Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the total votes which brings her to a total vote count of 272,892
- Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes for him in this election which brings him to about 3.1% of the total votes.

- County votes:
	1. Jefferson: 10.5% totaling 38,855 votes
  2. Denver: 82.8% totaling 306,055 votes
  3. Arapahoe: 6.7% totaling 24,801
  4. 

- Denver had the largest turnout of votes at 306,055.

- Candidate Diana DeGette won the election when she received 73.8% of the total votes with 272,892 votes out of 369,711 total votes

**SUMMARY**

Counties are important in all campaigns but sometimes we need to know more. More as in breaking things down a little smaller, as in cities. We need to know who a top candidate in each city is so we can point our data in a different direction. If we can see that which cities have a higher rate in determining which candidate will win the election, we are able to focus more on building a campaign within that city to grab all the voters we can! Taking all that new data and throwing it into a csv is practically exactly what we did this go around so it may be a significant choice! Second, we can use the information we gathered to look at city populations and how to get more voters in the future. Denver has over 7 time more votes then Jefferson County. Is that because Denver County just have an extremely higher population or is that because Jefferson and Arapahoe county just has a lot of people in their population that donâ€™t find the need to vote. This script can be modified to break down population counts and see WAY more data than what we did in this challenge.
